# Curve simulator with Java swing
This is a program that simulates and visualizes various types of curves. The user can create, remove, or move points. Additionally, the Casteljau algorithm for creating the B√©zier curve can be interactively visualized.

## Features
- Free addition and removal of control points
- Move points at runtime
- Draw Hermite curve
- Curve with natural start and parabolic end
- Closed curve
- Bezier curve
- Visualization of Cesteljau algorithm
- interactive UI
- Show tangents
